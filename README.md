### How to implement your own face mask detector

 - Fine tuning
 Load model: res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel.
 We Construct  new FC head(Fully connected layers), append it the base model and we freeze the base layers of the network(res10.*.caffemodel)
 -Notice: the weight sof the layers(base model) will not uploaded during the process of backpropagation. Whereas the head layer weight will be tunued. 
 - Training, testing and validation stage
 In this section, we load face mask dataset from disk and then train a model using tensorflow.keras 2.1.0.
 To perform your accuracy, you can change your hyperparameters(batch size and number of epoch learning rate)
 ```
 python3 fm_train.py --dataset dataset
 # After training you can test your classifier by:
 python3 detect_mask_picture.py --image examples/other.jpg
 ```
